The Spark team will be at Maker Faire Bay Area on May 17 and 18 and we won’t be alone. Since our beginning, collaboration has always been at the heart of what Spark does, and in truth it’s at the heart of the entire Maker movement. It’s also extraordinarily important in the “Internet of Things”, where product creators have to work together to enable interconnectivity that makes each product better.
