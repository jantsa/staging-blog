##Inpsiration and background

Headphones in and coffee at hand, my ritual skimming of news was going strong when I was shocked by a summary of a headlineÂ of an article which implied that people today are overwhelmed with information.  I stopped texting, paused the video I was watching, and in silence I took a long slow sip from my coffee.  In the background I felt someone was speaking and I couldn't quite understand them, but now I do.  The silence seemed to last forever as I stared into space, inspiration struck, and I knew I needed to help others like myself.  We needed a new device to help people really connect with eachother.  Something free from distractions, and slow to help shape thoughts.

This new device would capture the technological romanticism of the 1890s I thought; I Googled hard.  Needless to say, I struck gold.  I walked straight out of that meeting, and now I'm here to share Spark's exciting new development.


##Background Research

I think we all remember [#1227](https://xkcd.com/1227/)


#Introducing the Open Internet Telegraph

##Development update

Although this incredible project is still in early beta, we wanted to share some details.  This could very well be the world's first open source hardware and software wifi telegraph with end-to-end encryption and internet connectivity.  We believe in creating a connected ecosystem of devices, but also of people, so we won't be charging monthly fees.  You can't get that from text messages!


##Kickstarter?

You tell us!  If there is sufficient demand, we might consider introducing a kickstarter to produce limited edition beautiful wooden and brass Wifi Telegraphs.

"From early studies of electricity, electrical phenomena were known to travel with great speed, and many experimenters worked on the application of electricity to communications at a distance.
All the known effects of electricity - such as sparks, electrostatic attraction, chemical changes, electric shocks, and later electromagnetism - were applied to the problems of detecting controlled transmissions of electricity at various distances." - Wikipedia, Electrical Telegraph, 2014

Eight years since Western Union has discontinued all telegram services, Spark is reinventing the electrical telegraph online through the Spark Cloud.  Finally a telegraph with a RESTful API, push notifications, and end-to-end encryption.

Captivated by the possibilities of helping other



Earlier today while listening to music during a meeting, an article I was skimming mentioned something about people today being overwhelmed by information.  We all paused our streaming TV, and set out to build an exciting new way to slow things down.


Nowadays you don't have to look past your phone to be reminded that you're looking at your phone too often.  Modern technology keeps reminding us 

Thanks to cutting edge technology I was recently reminded that 

In these fast paced modern times, we can't help but be reminded that 


"The art of letter-writing is fast dyning out. ... We fire off a multitude of rapid and short notes, instead of sitting down to have a good talk over a real sheet of paper" --The Sunday Magazine, 1871 ( https://xkcd.com/1227/ )
