##Inspiration and background

Earlier this week, my ritual skimming of news was going strong when I came upon a shocking summary of a headline of an article which claimed that people today are being overwhelmed with information. Although I didn't have time to read it, the message resonated with me deeply: our beleaguered attention spans are increasingly under assault by a siege of ubiquitous media.  I stopped texting, paused the video I was watching, and walked straight out of the meeting I was in. I took a long slow sip from my coffee. And I began to wonder if the torrid pace of today's consumer is the very reason we've begun to celebrate certain hallmarks of an era where time was spent more thoughtfully.  What else could explain our newfound demand for artisanal carved ice cubes and mindfully mason-jarred, home crafted pickles? 

I realized that we all have the same hunger for purposeful connection. We needed a new device to help cut through the entropy separating us from one another, something free from distractions, something deliberate and slow to help shape our most valuable thoughts.  Something that would capture the technological romanticism of the 1890s while meeting the accessibility standards of today.  

It is with these goals in mind that I am proud to to share Spark's exciting new development.


#Introducing the Open Internet Telegraph

##Development update

Although this incredible project is still in early beta, we wanted to share some details.  This could very well be the world's first open source hardware and software Wi-Fi telegraph with end-to-end encryption and internet connectivity.  We believe in creating a connected ecosystem of devices, but also of people, so unlike the original Telegraph, we will not be charging by the word. In fact, we won't be charging any monthly fees.  You can't get that from text messages!   
Although this incredible project is still in early beta, we wanted to share some details.  We haven't checked, but this could very well be the world's first open Wi-Fi telegraph with end-to-end encryption and internet connectivity.  We believe in creating a connected ecosystem of devices, but also of people, so unlike the original Telegraph, we will not be charging by the word. In fact, if you own a Spark Core, we won't be charging any monthly fees for this service.  You can't get that from text messages!   

And, recognizing that not all of our users have mastered the demands of morse code, we've also included an autocorrect feature that will help smooth over common mistakes. 

(Maybe here you could somehow cut to an "embarassing" mistake like an extra dot instead of a dash?)


##Kickstarter?

You tell us!  If there is sufficient demand, we might consider introducing a kickstarter to produce limited edition beautiful wooden and brass Wifi Telegraphs.
